## Sunrise Movement 

### Sunrise Santa Barbara

### Sunrise Bay Area

### Sunrise Bay Radio

From April 2020 to June 2021, I co-lead the development and creation of a podcast for the Bay Area Hub of the Sunrise Movement, called Sunrise Bay Radio. Every month, we explored the intersection of the climate crisis with every aspect of our society, from the COVID-19 pandemic to racial justice. Check it out at [anchor.fm/sunrisebayradio](https://anchor.fm/sunrisebayradio).
