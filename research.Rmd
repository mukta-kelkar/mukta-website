## Current Projects

### MPA Design

### How do we best study MPAs for climate resilience?

## Past Projects

### Blue Whales & Navy Sonar

While completing my undergraduate degree at UC San Diego, I worked in the Marine Bioacoustics Lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. There I studied blue whale acoustic behavior and looked at the impact of climate change and Navy sonar on blue whale foraging calls.

### Variation in Hymenoptera species richness by land use

### Effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bee learning and locomotion
